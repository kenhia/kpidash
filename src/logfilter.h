/* logfilter.h — per-codepoint dedupe for LVGL's missing-glyph warning (WI #2646).
 *
 * LVGL logs `lv_draw_letter: glyph dsc. not found for U+<hex>` from
 * lv_draw_label.c on EVERY redraw of EVERY character the font does not
 * carry. A single unlucky character in one Service Card therefore writes to
 * the journal about once every two seconds, forever: WI #363 measured it for
 * `°`, and WI #2646 measured 3,844 lines in two hours for `·`.
 *
 * The warning is worth having exactly once per codepoint — it names the
 * character a publisher used and the font lacks. Every repeat after that is
 * noise that buries everything else kpidash logs.
 *
 * This is the pure half: it decides, it does not print. main.c registers the
 * printing half with lv_log_register_print_cb(), which is why lv_conf.h sets
 * LV_LOG_PRINTF to 0 — LVGL's own printf path is additive with the callback,
 * so leaving it on would emit every line twice and dedupe neither.
